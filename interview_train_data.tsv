Good day I write to bring to your notice of the delay we have been getting in funding our paypoint account after a successful transaction, this is seriously crippling our business as we can cannot cash into account (make payment) because the series of numerous transactions we did since Saturday has not been credited into my paypoint account, I must confess I am a bit disappointed knowing fully well that this season of rush due to the long holiday and banks not being open we fully relied on quickteller but things did not turn out good, we have lost lots of customers and have not met up with our expectations. I must confess business was bad this season (Christmas and new year holiday) due to the huge disappointed we got from Quickteller. Please kindly look into this and release our funds.

Please kindly respond as urgent. I made a payment of N2000 (two thousand naira) on the prepaid meter number 04248212450 since Friday 29, Dec. 2017 but the Meter Token was not generated. I have called severally on this, providing necessary details including the transaction reference number. The transaction was confirmed by the customer care representatives I spoke with and they promised to take action by forwarding the payment to the right department, and that the token will be sent to me within 6 hours. But unfortunately, this has become the same response I am being given each time I spoke with a customer care representative and I am yet to get the token. In frustration of this and as urgently as I need the light for usage, I initiated another payment of N350 (three hundred and fifty naira) on Sunday (31st December) morning to check if it will be successful, but unfortunately it was the same outcome; payment was deducted but token not generated. The transaction reference for the last payment is 888830316650.

I was not owing before because I've being subscribing for Gotv Plus this same way from my bank account. I tried to clear the error codes.

Dear support, Happy New Year. I noticed during the Christmas break that the value in my commision account went unnecessarily high much more than than what I should have, I was hoping it will be resolved after the holidays but to my surprise as at this morning the value still remains over 40,000naira. Unfortunately I haven't been recording my commission separately but am sure what I earn legitimately in the month of December can't be that much, I will appreciate if this can be looked at as soon as possible to enable me upload my commission for the month of December 2017 as work has began for the new month to avoid a mix up of our work. Thanking you in anticipation of a swift response. Kind Regards, Olayinka A design Perry's Place.	45	24	2

Dear Team, I sincerely want to appreciate your efforts in resolving the pin reset anormaly since last week. I am most grateful. Special thanks also goes to Mr Adedotun Aderogba for his professionalism in the discharge of his duties. I would also want to state the following: 1. We have had some cases of customer being debited wrongly by our Interswitch POS terminals despite the transaction being declined. We usually direct these customers to go and make complaints in the respective banks but their banks but after weeks, the banks keep telling them that Interswitch didn't reply their mails and therefore they should come and collect their cash from us. Please note that this has generated a lot of physical aggression from the said customers at our offices. 2. I was called last week by a customer care representative that we won #10,000 due to our transactions in December. However, we are yet to receive any update. Kindly contact relevant department please. We await your response. Thank you. God bless you SALAMI BABATUNDE 08061614148 On Jan 31, 2018 10:56 PM, "Eseosa Bashiru-Usman" eseosa.bashiru-usman@interswitchgroup.com> wrote: Dear Sir Good day to you and thank you for your mail.

I made the payment using first bank ATM platform and the successful transaction reference number quoted earlier was from quickteller SMS platform. Anyways, my smatcard number is 4622474082.

Dear Sir, Good afternoon and how are you doing today? Presume very fine. Sequel to the subject, My wife has a chemist shop within a location in Ibadan close to these areas. New Garage/ Akala Express/Odo Ona/ Apata/Liberty Academy/Ashipa etc and densely populated and unfortunately, there is no ATM machine around, the nearest ATM is about 45 to 50mins trekking distance and about 20 min driving distance from her shop. The shop is located along an road that is connected to several other roads. A filling station is beside her shop and another in front of her shop. In the light of this development, we will want to be a QUICKTELLER PAYPOINT AGENT or Apply to be an AGENT. Kindly let us know if the opportunity is available and the requirements to be an Agent and how long it will take to set it up. Thank you for your anticipated cooperation and usually timely response.

Please be informed that failed recharge transactions may take a minimum of 48 working hours (2 working days) for an automatic reversal to be effected. A review of your account shows that it is yet to be debited for the airtime purchase of N 1000 initiated. However, a blocked fund of the same amount was also placed on your balance pending final confirmation from the merchant. Please note that the fund will be unblocked and made available within the wait period, hence, no reversal is expected to impact on your account. Thank you for choosing Guaranty Trust Bank plc.

Dear Sir/Ma, The mail trail below refers. I contacted GTBank with regards a DSTV payment made via the quickteller platform for which I did not get value for. GTBank got back to me saying the merchant (Quickteller) responded that the transaction had now been settled and was successful. However, on checking the quickteller platform for the status of the transaction, even up until today, it still gives the message "Your Transaction is in progress. Your account was successfully debited and we are trying to notify DSTV Subscription." This transaction was attempted 19th of September, 2017 for the DSTV smartcard no - 1004726391 with transaction details shown in screenshot attachment #1. On 19th December, I attempted again to pay via quickteller using same smartcard number, and got the same error message. I was again debited by GTBank, and got no value for my payment. Transaction details screenshot is seen in attachment #2. It was on further investigation that I got to know that my Dad had changed his smart card number to 1029495546. I had been using the other smartcard no - 1004726391 to pay for the subscription via quickteller for close to 2 years, and was not told by my dad that the number had changed. Kindly help investigate this and initiate a refund as clearly, the smartcard number probably does not exist anymore and I was debited on both occasions, the value of 16,900 each, making a total of NGN 33,800.

This is sad because it was my first transaction the very day it was deployed been 21st of December 2017. This complain I have made since then yet nothing has been done. To this end went to your Port Harcourt office for same reason, it was tested once again the card debited with N1,000 yet no impact till now. Amount involve N10,300 and N1,000 on 21st and 27th of this month respectively. Agent no: 08178024043. Someone should empathise and expedite action as it has lingered for too long. If this cannot be resolved, I will prefer you remap it to another agent and refund my N85,000 to me as the terminal is not adding value to my business as expected and have not been utilized from the day it was deployed.

Hi Sheriff Today all withdrawals done through quickteller withdrawals are failing with response issuer or switch in operative. Please confirm if ISW is having issues We have emailed support in the past but they are shocking at responding and at times don’t ever get a response. Please assist ASAP as your support line never responds.	45	24	2
Good Afternoon. I made a complaint on the 29th of December, 2017 about my DSTV payment I made on the 22nd through Quickteller which was not remitted to DSTV and I had my account suspended through out the holiday which made it a horrible experience. I sent an email and I got a response with the reference number which is indicated on the subject of this email and it stated I will have a response within 24 working hours, but I am yet to get one. I have called the customer support number and after waiting for a total of 30 minutes, I was debited from my calling units and I still was not connected to anyone for assistance. Please, I will like to have my money reverted back to my account and I do not see the reason to want to use Quickteller anymore for any payment after I have had this unprofessional/shocking experience of paying for a service and still not having my money transferred to the appropriate beneficiary after 8 days of payment. And also, your self-dest support is very inefficient, time consuming and not cost effective due to the amount spent on the phone and still not getting connected to any Interswitch personnel. I look forward to getting a credit on my account for the money paid through Quickteller which has still not reflected at DSTV after 12 days. Kind regards, Henry Njepuome 07054005600	45	24	2

96 Good morning, Please I booked and airpeace flight on hold on the 29th of December 2017 and went straight to QuickTeller to payment like I have always done. I was put in the transaction no and the details came up. I made payment and was debited 43,400naira immediately and received a successful transaction email from Interswitch. On getting to the airport the airpeace attendant said the ticket hasn’t been paid and we couldn’t travel with the flight that day. I kindly ask that a refund be made to me as I wasn’t on that flight and QuickTeller didn’t make payment to airpeace on my behalf and yet debited my account of the sum. Find attached a copy of the successful transaction email. Thank You. Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPhone	45	24	2

Dear Interswitch, Kindly provide me with additional (if any) registration requirements and fee/commission structure of these categories: classic, standard and prestige. I will also like to know how these commissions are being deducted on eligible transactions. What charges are applicable to transactions? Are the charges computed separately or will be deducted from transaction amount? For example, if a customer wishes to pay N5000 PHCN bill. How much will I charge the customer? Is the transaction charge inclusive in the N5000? Any transaction limits? Can I run multiple locations with the same registration? Thank you.	24	13	0

It was blocked after I failed to get my password right after two attempts. It was similarly blocked in November for the same reason and then unblocked after I complained. This time around, I had written drawing attention to my being bounced out of your platform, but nothing has been done so far. My email address is aonanuga1957@yahoo.com. And my phone number is 08033066422. Please rectify. Adebayo Onanuga Sent from my iPhone Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPhone	62	9	0

Good-day. I made an interswitch payment for one Ms. Emem Nse Akpan today for her JAMB/UTME registration but her PIN has not yet been vended. The only thing I can provided is her profile code 1451754888, as the email address she provided me at the time of her payment erdoontuk45@yahoo.com did not yet exist and the receipt was not received; thus, I am without a transaction ID to ref the payment. But if there is a way her payment can be tracked using her profile code, I'd like to use that option. Please, I'd like this issue resolved as soon as possible so as for her to complete her registration process. Thanks.	45	24	2

96 Hello, I would like to lay a complaint on an unsuccessful transfer which wasn’t reversed to my account. On the 8th of December, 2017 I transferred using the Quickteller app on my phone from my Zenith bank account to a diamond bank account. Initially the recipient got an alert and immediately also got a reverse transaction. After that I didn’t get any reverse on my account, I have contacted and visited my bank about the issue and they told me the transaction was unsuccessful so I would get a reverse of the payment I made but till date I am yet to receive the money on my account, so yesterday at the bank I was told to also send an email to Quickteller and report about the transaction as well. I would acknowledge a prompt response to my mail and also give answers to any questions you may have for me. Thank you and hope to get a feedback. Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPhone	45	24	2

Though I have laid complains to my QUICKTELLER ACCOUNT OFFICCER, and have written to support team but for a whole period of one week my wallet have not been credited. I have been advised to write to this section of your organization to also appeal that my wallet be credited. I have been to the bank to confirm the status of the transaction and it was verified as POSTED which implies that the money was actually paid into the account. This made me miss lectures in school for about three hours of moving from one desk/station to another. I had to go through this bank enquiry process because the bank was either out of receipt papers or something impeded the generation and printing of receipts as at when I did the transaction. Please I humbly ask, plead and demand that my wallet be adequately funded. Attached is the teller I use to make the deposit. NOTE: The depositors name used is ANOKWURU CHISOM CHRISTIAN Thank you for your anticipated aid and support. Anokwuru Chisom Christian	45	24	2

Good morning, I reached out a while back as regards a third party payout system for bet companies over a year ago, the project development has been slow but moving forward despite that fact. The scope of the project has changed, not entirely, the initial plan was to make use of physical cards, but that has changed, we have decided to go physical card-less, so we decided to adopt a virtual card system similar to what is being done at getbarter.co, we would like to adopt the use of verve as the virtual cards on our platform, with all its capabilities for card-less transactions. Would that be a possibility? If yes, what are the prerequisites? Akindele Yusuf	65	13	0

Hello, Recently used the Quickteller platform(web) to transfer money to a Zenith Bank account, first OTP was sent and entered but transaction was unsuccessful, did the same a second time and the transaction was successful, only for me to find out i'd already been debited for the first transaction. To make matters even worse, there is NO communication from your social media handle after lodging a complaint yesterday. None. Please look into this and revert. See image of transaction below.

Dear ifis, My name is Fesan Joel S.,a paypoint agent in kontagora Niger state with agent mobile number as 08034136790 I did cashout of #15,000 on 27/1/18 and another cashout of #5,000 on 29/1/18 via webpay and which both transactions were not credited into my account and out of desperation to credit my account in order to do some transactions for my customers I paid another #40,500 through pay-direct at first bank on 29/1/18 and also this was not credited to my Quickteller account. This is annoying,unpleasant, and unhealthy for this kind of business because it will make the agents to lose customers. Kindly find a way out and credit all my money into my Quickteller account as this is seriously affecting my business. The total money to be credited into my account now is #60,500. Below here are the evidences of each transaction which was an SMS from Quickteller confirming the transaction which i screengrabbed and a receipt received from first bank for the direct-pay. Thank you. Joel Fesan.	9	24	2

Dear Team, I sincerely want to appreciate your efforts in resolving the pin reset anormaly since last week. I am most grateful. Special thanks also goes to Mr Adedotun Aderogba for his professionalism in the discharge of his duties. I would also want to state the following: 1. We have had some cases of customer being debited wrongly by our Interswitch POS terminals despite the transaction being declined. We usually direct these customers to go and make complaints in the respective banks but their banks but after weeks, the banks keep telling them that Interswitch didn't reply their mails and therefore they should come and collect their cash from us. Please note that this has generated a lot of physical aggression from the said customers at our offices. 2. I was called last week by a customer care representative that we won #10,000 due to our transactions in December. However, we are yet to receive any update. Kindly contact relevant department please. We await your response. Thank you. God bless you SALAMI BABATUNDE 08061614148	45	24	2
