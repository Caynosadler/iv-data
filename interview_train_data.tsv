Good day I write to bring to your notice of the delay we have been getting in funding our paypoint account after a successful transaction, this is seriously crippling our business as we can cannot cash into account (make payment) because the series of numerous transactions we did since Saturday has not been credited into my paypoint account, I must confess I am a bit disappointed knowing fully well that this season of rush due to the long holiday and banks not being open we fully relied on quickteller but things did not turn out good, we have lost lots of customers and have not met up with our expectations. I must confess business was bad this season (Christmas and new year holiday) due to the huge disappointed we got from Quickteller. Please kindly look into this and release our funds.

Please kindly respond as urgent. I made a payment of N2000 (two thousand naira) on the prepaid meter number 04248212450 since Friday 29, Dec. 2017 but the Meter Token was not generated. I have called severally on this, providing necessary details including the transaction reference number. The transaction was confirmed by the customer care representatives I spoke with and they promised to take action by forwarding the payment to the right department, and that the token will be sent to me within 6 hours. But unfortunately, this has become the same response I am being given each time I spoke with a customer care representative and I am yet to get the token. In frustration of this and as urgently as I need the light for usage, I initiated another payment of N350 (three hundred and fifty naira) on Sunday (31st December) morning to check if it will be successful, but unfortunately it was the same outcome; payment was deducted but token not generated.

Dear support, Happy New Year. I noticed during the Christmas break that the value in my commision account went unnecessarily high much more than than what I should have, I was hoping it will be resolved after the holidays but to my surprise as at this morning the value still remains over 40,000naira. Unfortunately I haven't been recording my commission separately but am sure what I earn legitimately in the month of December can't be that much, I will appreciate if this can be looked at as soon as possible to enable me upload my commission for the month of December 2017 as work has began for the new month to avoid a mix up of our work.

Dear Team, I sincerely want to appreciate your efforts in resolving the pin reset anormaly since last week. I am most grateful. Special thanks also goes to Mr Adedotun Aderogba for his professionalism in the discharge of his duties. I would also want to state the following: 1. We have had some cases of customer being debited wrongly by our Interswitch POS terminals despite the transaction being declined. We usually direct these customers to go and make complaints in the respective banks but their banks but after weeks, the banks keep telling them that Interswitch didn't reply their mails and therefore they should come and collect their cash from us. Please note that this has generated a lot of physical aggression from the said customers at our offices. 2. I was called last week by a customer care representative that we won #10,000 due to our transactions in December. However, we are yet to receive any update. Kindly contact relevant department please. We await your response. Thank you. God bless you SALAMI BABATUNDE 08061614148 On Jan 31, 2018 10:56 PM, "Eseosa Bashiru-Usman" eseosa.bashiru-usman@interswitchgroup.com> wrote: Dear Sir Good day to you and thank you for your mail.

Hello, This 2 transaction was failed before we proceed to make a new payment using remita, and according to your staff when we called on phone to make an inquiry about it, she told us the transaction failed and direct us to make a new payment in respect to this that it will be reversed back to the account.

I made the payment using first bank ATM platform and the successful transaction reference number quoted earlier was from quickteller SMS platform. Anyways, my smatcard number is 4622474082.

Please I have an issue with my ATM card.I have a recently expired master card debit card I've been using.it was to expire on 31/01/2018,so I had to get another one. Previously I've been using the Short code *322# to recharge my phone and that of others,but since I got my new card,which I activated on the ATM for quickteller transaction and was debited the sum of #1.00 , the same short code no longer works with my new debit card. It says the Card or account linked to my phone numbed is invalid. Does it mean my expired ATM card is still taking the place of my new card because its still linked, or what?

We acknowledge receipt of your e-mail and regret any inconvenience this may have caused you. Please be informed that failed recharge transactions may take a minimum of 48 working hours (2 working days) for an automatic reversal to be effected. A review of your account shows that it is yet to be debited for the airtime purchase of N 1000 initiated. However, a blocked fund of the same amount was also placed on your balance pending final confirmation from the merchant. Please note that the fund will be unblocked and made available within the wait period, hence, no reversal is expected to impact on your account. Thank you for choosing Guaranty Trust Bank plc.

Dear Sir/Ma, The mail trail below refers. I contacted GTBank with regards a DSTV payment made via the quickteller platform for which I did not get value for. GTBank got back to me saying the merchant (Quickteller) responded that the transaction had now been settled and was successful. However, on checking the quickteller platform for the status of the transaction, even up until today, it still gives the message "Your Transaction is in progress. Your account was successfully debited and we are trying to notify DSTV Subscription." This transaction was attempted 19th of September, 2017 for the DSTV smartcard no - 1004726391 with transaction details shown in screenshot attachment #1. On 19th December, I attempted again to pay via quickteller using same smartcard number, and got the same error message. I was again debited by GTBank, and got no value for my payment. Transaction details screenshot is seen in attachment #2. It was on further investigation that I got to know that my Dad had changed his smart card number to 1029495546. I had been using the other smartcard no - 1004726391 to pay for the subscription via quickteller for close to 2 years, and was not told by my dad that the number had changed. Kindly help investigate this and initiate a refund as clearly, the smartcard number probably does not exist anymore and I was debited on both occasions, the value of 16,900 each, making a total of NGN 33,800. Pls see transaction summary below, and do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further clarifications.

To this end went to your Port Harcourt office for same reason, it was tested once again the card debited with N1,000 yet no impact till now.

Good Afternoon. I made a complaint on the 29th of December, 2017 about my DSTV payment I made on the 22nd through Quickteller which was not remitted to DSTV and I had my account suspended through out the holiday which made it a horrible experience. I sent an email and I got a response with the reference number which is indicated on the subject of this email and it stated I will have a response within 24 working hours, but I am yet to get one. I have called the customer support number and after waiting for a total of 30 minutes, I was debited from my calling units and I still was not connected to anyone for assistance. Please, I will like to have my money reverted back to my account and I do not see the reason to want to use Quickteller anymore for any payment after I have had this unprofessional/shocking experience of paying for a service and still not having my money transferred to the appropriate beneficiary after 8 days of payment. And also, your self-dest support is very inefficient, time consuming and not cost effective due to the amount spent on the phone and still not getting connected to any Interswitch personnel. I look forward to getting a credit on my account for the money paid through Quickteller which has still not reflected at DSTV after 12 days.

Dear Interswitch, Kindly provide me with additional (if any) registration requirements and fee/commission structure of these categories: classic, standard and prestige. I will also like to know how these commissions are being deducted on eligible transactions. What charges are applicable to transactions? Are the charges computed separately or will be deducted from transaction amount? For example, if a customer wishes to pay N5000 PHCN bill. How much will I charge the customer? Is the transaction charge inclusive in the N5000? Any transaction limits? Can I run multiple locations with the same registration? Thank you.	Payment Confirmation	Confirm Transaction Status	3

96 Hello, I would like to lay a complaint on an unsuccessful transfer which wasn’t reversed to my account. On the 8th of December, 2017 I transferred using the Quickteller app on my phone from my Zenith bank account to a diamond bank account. Initially the recipient got an alert and immediately also got a reverse transaction. After that I didn’t get any reverse on my account, I have contacted and visited my bank about the issue and they told me the transaction was unsuccessful so I would get a reverse of the payment I made but till date I am yet to receive the money on my account, so yesterday at the bank I was told to also send an email to Quickteller and report about the transaction as well. I would acknowledge a prompt response to my mail and also give answers to any questions you may have for me. Thank you and hope to get a feedback.

Good day, I am Anokwuru Chisom Christian, a pay point agent on your great platform. It is with a sorrowed heart I write to you. Sorrow, for the fact that I made deposit, that is direct bank deposit of the sum of FIVE THOUSAND NAIRA (#5000) since on Thursday the 25th day of January 2018 into your First bank Account 3096902289 but my wallet have not been credited. Though I have laid complains to my QUICKTELLER ACCOUNT OFFICCER, and have written to support team but for a whole period of one week my wallet have not been credited. I have been advised to write to this section of your organization to also appeal that my wallet be credited. I have been to the bank to confirm the status of the transaction and it was verified as POSTED which implies that the money was actually paid into the account. This made me miss lectures in school for about three hours of moving from one desk/station to another. I had to go through this bank enquiry process because the bank was either out of receipt papers or something impeded the generation and printing of receipts as at when I did the transaction. Please I humbly ask, plead and demand that my wallet be adequately funded. Attached is the teller I use to make the deposit.

I just got a text message from quickteller saying payment successful. Note: No code was included for me to load my meter. Also be informed that after I was charged the first time on the quickteller app, I later used quickteller online to recharge my meter and was successful. So I was charged twice for one transaction.

Good morning, I reached out a while back as regards a third party payout system for bet companies over a year ago, the project development has been slow but moving forward despite that fact. The scope of the project has changed, not entirely, the initial plan was to make use of physical cards, but that has changed, we have decided to go physical card-less, so we decided to adopt a virtual card system similar to what is being done at getbarter.co, we would like to adopt the use of verve as the virtual cards on our platform, with all its capabilities for card-less transactions.

Dear ifis, My name is Fesan Joel S.,a paypoint agent in kontagora Niger state with agent mobile number as 08034136790 I did cashout of #15,000 on 27/1/18 and another cashout of #5,000 on 29/1/18 via webpay and which both transactions were not credited into my account and out of desperation to credit my account in order to do some transactions for my customers I paid another #40,500 through pay-direct at first bank on 29/1/18 and also this was not credited to my Quickteller account. This is annoying,unpleasant, and unhealthy for this kind of business because it will make the agents to lose customers. Kindly find a way out and credit all my money into my Quickteller account as this is seriously affecting my business. The total money to be credited into my account now is #60,500. Below here are the evidences of each transaction which was an SMS from Quickteller confirming the transaction which i screengrabbed and a receipt received from first bank for the direct-pay.

Dear Team, I sincerely want to appreciate your efforts in resolving the pin reset anormaly since last week. I am most grateful. Special thanks also goes to Mr Adedotun Aderogba for his professionalism in the discharge of his duties. I would also want to state the following: 1. We have had some cases of customer being debited wrongly by our Interswitch POS terminals despite the transaction being declined. We usually direct these customers to go and make complaints in the respective banks but their banks but after weeks, the banks keep telling them that Interswitch didn't reply their mails and therefore they should come and collect their cash from us. Please note that this has generated a lot of physical aggression from the said customers at our offices. 2. I was called last week by a customer care representative that we won #10,000 due to our transactions in December. However, we are yet to receive any update. Kindly contact relevant department please. We await your response. Thank you. God bless you SALAMI BABATUNDE 08061614148	Documentation Request/Service Inquiries	Request for new or existing service	0

Hi Good day, My name is Aloysius and I am one of your agents with the company name Singleclick Nigeria Limited. I have a challenge and I dont understand why its taking this long to be rectified. I did a USSD transfer of N5,000 on the 14th of December, 2017 to your First Bank account 3096902289 from my FCMB with Account name Singleclick Nigeria Limited. For more than 2 months, i have not been credited and all my efforts to get my account to be credited has yielded nothing. I have not been able to do business because of this delay for the past two months and I sincerely want to understand what the issue is. Attached here is the report i got from my bank after I filled for dispense error but the bank said that the fund had already been credited to the destination account which is your account. Please, I either want my money back or my account credited or I am going to litigate your guys for this and Quickteller will pay for all the damages this delay has caused me. My username is 2348035504753 and my company name is Singleclick Nigeria Limited. I hope this is rectified immediately.

No! I am yet to receive token for any of the two payments (2,000 and 350) complained. I even made another payment of 300 (three hundred naira) yesterday evening (2nd January) out of frustration, still it ended as the same. I have visited banks to make another payment today, I was equally told they are faced with the same challenge as token would not also be generated. I have no other means of paying for token as of now, and my three payments which totals 2,650 were neither processed nor reversed. I must confessed that this has been a major upset for me and my family as it Mar the festive mood for us. I hope you will still do the right thing as soon as possible. All my calls to the BEDC customer care have been a total waste of time, energy and airtime units. Thanks.

Good day to you, Happy New Year Trust this mail meets you well I made a booking online on First Nation airlines website with the ref AAXQ8N for OKEOWO/OLUWASEUN SIMEON on the 10th of November 2017 while trying to make payment for the booking I got an error message with transaction status unconfirmed and transaction reference 01101711011726 with the payment of N50,300 being deducted from my account without issuing the ticket. I contacted First Nation and they told me that the ticket wasn’t issued and a reversal will be done. After waiting for a week I didn't get the reversal so I contacted my bank Guaranty Trust bank(GTB) to resolve this issue. I was told the reversal will be done between 5-8days working days. I have waited since November 2017 till today, I’ve called Gtconnect several times, I visited the bank twice on this same issue and no head way till now. I called Gtconnect again yesterday morning to do a follow up since the last mail they sent to me was to get the reversal on or before 2Jan 2018 and the response I got from Gtconnect was that the case is closed and nothing could be done from their end that I should contact first Nation since the money was with them. I was in First Nation office this morning and was told to contact interswitch since you are d link between both banks. I was told that reversal will be initiated by interswitch and that is why am contacting you since my money is taking too long than expected. I'm not happy about this whole issue because GTbank has contacted you on this issue and the request was declined which was why my bank has directed me to go to the airline which holds my money in their account Kindly contact First Nation Airlines on this issue and rectify on this transaction The name of the cardholder is ROSIJI OLANIKE and you can contact GTBank on this transaction has it’s a known case with them Please find attached the screen shot of the transaction error Thanks as I await your prompt response Regards, Olanike Rosiji Virus-free. www.avg.com	Payment Confirmation	Confirm Transaction Status	0

Dear FBN and Interswitch Teams, This is to formally express our dissatisfaction over inconsistency in settlement of both the customer(QCPTA) and the ISO by the FBN settlement team. This is what we observed : According to the agreement we signed with INTERSWITCH,settlement is meant to done within 24 hours after close of business unless the transactions are carried out on Friday or there is public holiday. However,the FBN settlement team will delay settlements meant for two or three days intentionally and make the payment one after the other instead of paying the accumulated sum once.We had sent mail to Kofoworola and other members of INTERSWITCH team regarding this unprofessional and unacceptable best practice by the FBN settlement team. We hereby request for permanent and immediate solution to this problem in the interest of FBN,INTERSWITCH and other parties before we take appropriate action by informing the appropriate regulatory body. Even if there are challenges in making the settlement,we expect the FBN team and the INTERSWITCH to communicate to us by telling us what is wrong . We await your responses . Thank you.

After the transfer of the said about 6k I was debited with balance of 52,992:52. Why the beneficiary have not gotten the value till now. Its sad that you have not been attending to my mails even till now my #10000 still remains unresolved. I might stop using this quicktteller because I can see they are not encouraging. I beg to allow the beneficiary receives her money. The worst about you is that your customer call center is not going rather than keeping one beside machine voice.

I hereby write to demand for the refund of the successful transaction I made on 2/1/2018 to purchase JAMB ePIN but has not been dispensed/ vended. REASON: The candidate I assisted to make the payment via www.quickteller.com is to compulsorily resume school( Boarding school) in Niger today. Hence yesterday was the only time he had to to the registration since there would be no means to do that while in school. The Parents to the candidate with me, contacted HOLLARAM CBT CENTRE (Faloye Dotun) and they advised we purchase another with the same code, we did and it was momentarily dispensed but it showed clearly that the CBT CENTRE was the vendor. Hence i demand the refund of the money I earlier paid through quickteller.com as it would amount to waste on money and double ePIN for a candidate.

Kindly refer to my correspondence of December, 2017 on the same subject and other previous mails, I am highly disappointed that no logical conclusion was reached on my request to refund my money - NGN 2000 after the said amount was deducted on my QT agent wallet on October, 25, 2017 and the DSTV account was never activated. I have made several complaints to various relevant quarters. Kindly note that a case number ISW-654843-D4K5Y7 was created by you on the same subject on Monday 27th November, 2017 with expected resolution date as 28th/11/ 2017.

Yesterday, however, i received a text from quickteller telling me that the payment for the token was successful, but i wasn't given a token, i was only given a REF number: 8889-2953-8107.

Since I got a debit SMS alert from my Bank - First Bank of Nigeria, I expected that the recipient would be notified of the complete transaction. But to my surprise, I got a call that he hasn’t received the money yet. It is worthy to note that I made another transfer of NGN 5,000 previously same day which was successful. I checked my quick teller profile this morning to see the records of the all the previous transfers made to the said account but couldn't trace the sum of money in question. Kindly help look into this and revert as soon as possible as this money is required for the purchase of some items. I have attached the transfer records made to the UBA account and my FBN SMS debit alerts (for both NGN 5,000 and NGN 11,000) that was made on the 4th of January 2018. Thank you.

Hello Good Morning. I tried to pay my electric bill (EKEDC Prepaid) using Quickteller yesterday, unfortunately, the transaction was declined and i was billed. I tried to do this twice and was billed 4000 for each transaction (totalling 8000) As it turns out, one of the transactions had apparently been successful even though the Quickteller Webapp had stated it was not (forcing me to find a solution elsewhere and inconveniently increasing my expenses yesterday) As such, I request a refund of 4000 which is the left over balance from my transaction. I hope this is treated with urgency. Best Regards Afam Odusola-Stevenson	User Account/Access Management	Password Reset	0

Hello, I have this issue with case number ISW-637628-F2B9Q5 which due attention has not been given to. On the 13th of December 2017 I finally got a mail informing me that the merchants account was not actually funded (When one Chike Orji from support department informed me that the merchant has been funded), and that when it is funded it will be reversed back to me. Its been 6months now and I just cant understand where the money is if it has been deducted from my account and not paid to the merchant. This will be my last mail on this matter as I see that interswitch just set up all the paypoint agents without having a structure in place to deal with issues like this. Failure to get a FAVOURABLE response from you, I will institute legal action against Interswitch, Guarantee Trust Bank, Peoples Pride (the merchant). I can imagine how many million Nigerians are having similar issues, what if the money involved had been a substantial amount, is that how for 6months my money cannot be accounted for?

body{font-family:Corbel,Arial;font-size:14px} Dear Support, My name is Mofoluso Aribisala and my Quickteller account ID is faribisala@gmail.com (same a s this email address) I write to call your attention to 4 (four) unsuccessful Eco Disco electrical power credit purchase attempts on my Quickteller account earlier this morning.

There was also a failed payment of N5,000 debited to my Diamond bank card and N3,000 from my virtual Quickteller card. In total, I was debited N27,800 but did not receive any electrical credit token. I would appreciate your immediate reversion/refund of the funds. Your prompt revert would be highly appreciated.

Hello, I am not happy with the way issues pertaining to a transaction I initiated and failed, is being treated. Firstly, on November 10, 2017, at about 10:00:39 AM, I initiated a transaction using my quickteller account with the email address 'akinalone@yahoo.com', (Find attached, screenshot details of the transaction), to an EcoBank Account holder: Samuel Tobechukwu Odimegwu - 4322027838, the sum of N50, 000.00. I got a confirmation text (Transfer of NGN 50,000.00 to Samuel Tobechukwu Odimegw was successful.ECO Account Number: 4322027838 has been credited. Your transfer reference number GTB.WEB.CA.ECO.AC.101117100039.78JTAXV4). I was debited from my bank, GTBank, but days after, the receiver was yet to receive the money. I made a complaint and filled a dispense error form at one of my bank's branches, requesting a reversal of funds. A few days later, the receiver got an alert of the sum of N100,000.00, instead of N50,000.00. he withdrew the sum of N50,000.00. Immediately, he received a debit alert, the sum of N100,000.00 had been deducted from his account. Although he didn't have up to the 100,000.00, so he now has a balanced deficit of N20,000.00. I made a complaint at GTBank and recently I got a mail; "Dear AKINKUNMI ANTHONY OBAKEYE, Thank you for contacting Guaranty Trust Bank. Your request 18011563835 - Dispense Error on GTBank Acquired Web has been closed. This has been escalated to Interswitch Thank You, GTBank" Now I ask Interswitch, what is going on with my transaction? I don't mind coming to your office if I do not get a swift response from you! I need a fast response now, no matter what it is, just respond!!! the money is not a little sum that can be overlooked now!

Good morning. I did a transaction (transferred money) using quickteller precisely by 3.16pm on the 2nd of February, 2018 and it stated that the transaction cannot be completed now, that i should try again later, only to get an sms alert from my bank (sterling bank) that my account as been debited with the said amount (5000naira). The said amount is yet to be credited back to my account and the person i sent the money to (using Zenith bank) as not seen the money till date. I just want to confirm if the error is from your platform (quickteller) as i didn't get any message of successful transaction from quickteller but my money as been deducted. Should i inform my bank first? Or can you be of help? Thank you.	Payment Confirmation	Confirm Transaction Status	0

Gdday Sir. Based on your reply, from the onset you did not understand my complain. I complained that my Stanbic Ibtc Bank (ATM card) was debited by Fidelity Bank because I used the card to make payment for an Air Peace ticket transaction. The transaction stated that it was SUCCESSFUL but when i opened the Transaction Narrative number (ABBMG4) given to me by Air Peace, IT SHOWED NO TICKET. I have to pay for another ticket for the customers on the same day, which means my account was debited twice. I called Fidelity Bank to complain but they asked me to call my bank Stanbic Ibtc Bank which i did and up till this moment, i have not received the money back to my account. Am surprised to see your mail this today claiming that transaction was successful and no need for reversal. Please relate with Inter switch group, Air Peace and Fidelity Bank to refund my money accordingly. This happened on 16th January, 2018. I have attached copy of transaction received from fidelity Bank on that day. Am awaiting your speedy action.

Firstly, on November 10, 2017, at about 10:00:39 AM, I initiated a transaction using my quickteller account with the email address 'akinalone@yahoo.com', (Find attached, screenshot details of the transaction), to an EcoBank Account holder: Samuel Tobechukwu Odimegwu - 4322027838, the sum of N50, 000.00. I got a confirmation text (Transfer of NGN 50,000.00 to Samuel Tobechukwu Odimegw was successful.ECO Account Number: 4322027838 has been credited. Your transfer reference number GTB.WEB.CA.ECO.AC.101117100039.78JTAXV4). I was debited from my bank, GTBank, but days after, the receiver was yet to receive the money. I made a complaint and filled a dispense error form at one of my bank's branches, requesting a reversal of funds. A few days later, the receiver got an alert of the sum of N100,000.00, instead of N50,000.00. he withdrew the sum of N50,000.00. Immediately, he received a debit alert, the sum of N100,000.00 had been deducted from his account. Although he didn't have up to the 100,000.00, so he now has a balanced deficit of N20,000.00. I made a complaint at GTBank and recently I got a mail; "Dear AKINKUNMI ANTHONY OBAKEYE, Thank you for contacting Guaranty Trust Bank. Your request 18011563835 - Dispense Error on GTBank Acquired Web has been closed. This has been escalated to Interswitch Thank You, GTBank" Now I ask Interswitch, what is going on with my transaction? I don't mind coming to your office if I do not get a swift response from you! I need a fast response now, no matter what it is, just respond!!! the money is not a little sum that can be overlooked now! I am a practising investigative journalist with a very serious online platform, and if it's not treated properly, I will do a detailed publication about this. it is not a threat, but I mean every alphabet of it! My contacts are: Mobile: 08077203384 Email: akinalone@yahoo.com cc akynalone@gmail.com My GTBank details: AKINKUNMI ANTHONY OBAKEYE 0024884764 I chose to send this mail to all of you because the corporate communications department will understand better, what a really bad story can do to a brand like yours, both online and offline.

Hi. My name is Okonkwo Ifeanyichukwu Valentine. I replaced my UBA master card about a week ago and now experience some difficulty. While my quickter profile bears my correct mobile number, 07031812421,however, if I want to execute a transaction, it shows an entirely different no, which means I wouldn't receive the OTP codes. In other words, the codes are sent to a wrong number which makes impossible for me to execute my transactions. Kindly rectify this problem for me as soon as you can. Thank you.

Dear ifis, My name is Fesan Joel S, a paypoint agent in kontagora Niger state with agent mobile number as 08034136790 I did cashout of #15,000 on 27/1/18 and another cashout of #5,000 on 29/1/18 via webpay and which both transactions were not credited into my account and out of desperation to credit my account in order to do some transactions for my customers I paid another #40,500 through pay-direct at first bank on 29/1/18 and also this was not credited to my Quickteller account. Another webpay transaction of 1,400 done on 6/2/18 was also not credited into my account This is annoying,unpleasant, and unhealthy for this kind of business because it will make the agents to lose customers. Kindly find a way out and credit all my money into my Quickteller account as this is seriously affecting my business. The total money to be credited into my account now is #61,400. Below here are the evidences of each transaction which was an SMS from Quickteller confirming the transaction which i screengrabbed and a receipt received from first bank for the direct-pay.

Dear ifis, Does it mean that each time I encountered any challenge as regards been a Quickteller pay point agent I had to come to Lagos all the way from Niger state? The other time I paid for POS machine since November 2017 ,it took me to come to Lagos in January 2018 for the pos issue to be resolved now its an issue of crediting my account which I had been battling with since January 27th last month till date it has not been resolved. I have made several unpicked calls to Customer care line as regards this and the picked calls yielded no result except my airtime wastage and also several mails which yielded no result except time wastage. Kindly fund my Quickteller account with all the money I paid either through pay direct, webpay which the evidences has been sent to you in the earlier mail or provide the means by which I can short down my agency status and retrieve my money even if it will take me to come to Lagos .
