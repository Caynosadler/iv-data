Hi Good day, My name is Aloysius and I am one of your agents with the company name Singleclick Nigeria Limited. I have a challenge and I dont understand why its taking this long to be rectified. I did a USSD transfer of N5,000 on the 14th of December, 2017 to your First Bank account 3096902289 from my FCMB with Account name Singleclick Nigeria Limited. For more than 2 months, i have not been credited and all my efforts to get my account to be credited has yielded nothing. I have not been able to do business because of this delay for the past two months and I sincerely want to understand what the issue is. Attached here is the report i got from my bank after I filled for dispense error but the bank said that the fund had already been credited to the destination account which is your account. Please, I either want my money back or my account credited or I am going to litigate your guys for this and Quickteller will pay for all the damages this delay has caused me. My username is 2348035504753 and my company name is Singleclick Nigeria Limited. I hope this is rectified immediately.
